                        <h4 class="teal-text light">Entrance</h4>
                        Upon entering Desolate Tomb, you will be greeted by a room that spans downwards. it is relatively safe to jump down as long as you stay on the side of the entrance. This room will be surrounded by mobs and one mini-boss traversing the center. The mini-boss in the center must be killed to open the dragon pulse which will lead you to the first boss. This mini-boss is also what progresses your daily quest for Desolate Tomb, meaning he should not be killed until all party members are present in the dungeon! There are two main strategies in killing this mini-boss.

                                            The general strategy to clear this room is for one party member to aggro the mini-boss running to the bottom left of the room where all the mobs will converge and get AOE'd down. This is the recommended method but may not be feasable for a low AP party as the mobs will perform a lot of CC abilities, allowing a lot of damage to go through and killing a lot of party members.

                                            If you have an Assassin in your party, the Assassin can perma-stealth on the main boss and aggro all the mobs in the room. If the Assassin is well geared they can kill the mini-boss by themselves, if they aren't then they can go through their perma-stealth rotation until the mobs in the room de-aggro and pull mini-boss by himself to the rest of the party stationed at the stairs at the bottom of the entrance.

                        Jang Ghibu will be the first boss you encounter in Desolate Tomb. He has the skill set of a Force Master and is accompanied by his two wives Mengwol and Muwol, both of which as destroyers. The fight with Jang Ghibu is comprised of 3 main phases occuring at 70%, 40%, and 20% HP.

                                            Jang Ghibu alternates between 2 stances, beginning with fire stance then switching at every major phase. Jang Ghibu's fire phase is contains mostly blockable attacks, occasionally casting a high damage AOE around him. Jang Ghibu's ice phase is comepletely blockable making it extremely easy to tank during his ice phase.

                                            Mengwol might be difficult to tank at first, but is fairly easy to deal with once you get used to her attack pattern. Mengwol has many unblockable attacks and makes it difficult for melees to tank her which is why it is recommended for people new to this dungeon to assign a ranged tank to her. This being said, melees can tank Mengwol fairly easily by circling around her, causing her to miss all her skillshots.

                                            Muwol has the most basic attack pattern of the 3 bosses. Her attacks are all blockable and is made up of 4 attacks; 3 downward strikes followed by a parry spin. Be wary of Muwol's spin, getting parried and stunned will allow her to knock you up which deals quite a bit of damage. You can freely hit into her spin 0.5 seconds after she begins spinning.

                        <h5 class="teal-text"><i class="material-icons left" style="padding-top:1px;margin-left: 4px;">query_builder</i>Preparation</h5>
                        Before you engage on Jang Ghibu, be sure that your party has specced their tab escape to allow them to escape freeze, as there will be multiple occurences where Jang Ghibu will freeze your entire team. You will also have to designate tanks for each Mengwol, Muwol, and Jang Ghibu. Mengwol (wife on the left from where you enter) is very punishing to melee tanks if inexperienced and as such is recommended to have a ranged class to tank her. Muwol (wife on the right form where you enter) is a fairly simple add and can be tanked by anybody. It is recommended to have a blocker tank Jang Ghibu as dealing damage the Jang Ghibu is not the focus for most of the fight.
                        <br><br>
                        <h5 class="teal-text"><i class="material-icons left" style="padding-top:1px;margin-left: 4px;">fast_forward</i>Initiation</h5>
                        When the fight starts, both the wives will "send their love" to Jang Ghibu. This refers to a defensive buff that each of the wives will transfer to Jang Ghibu, each giving a 45% damage reduction buff. At this stage, each tank will jump onto their respective targets; ideally pulling both the wives away from the center as the main boss will occasionally cast a high-damage AOE around him. Jang Ghibu will have a fire stance and an ice stance, beginning with fire stance and changing stances during each phase. The goal at this point is to get each of the wives' down to 70% HP, at which Jang Ghibu will send his love to the wife, transferring his 45% damage reduction buff to the wives.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="new badge left cyan darken-2" data-badge-caption="" style="margin-right:10px;margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;">NOTE</span>
                        It is important that the party does not kill a wife before Jang Ghibu is defeated! Killing a wife before that will cause a soft enrage wiping the party.
                        <br><br>
                        At this point, both Mengwol and Muwol will have a 45% buff, Jang Ghibu will have no buffs. Whoever is not tanking a wife will move to Jang Ghibu and DPS him down. When Jang Ghibu is reduced to 70% HP he will request for love, calling back his wives. Mengwol and Muwol will jump to his side. Upon landing, Jang Ghibu will freeze everyone in the room. This freeze can be iframed fairly easily, the freeze will happen just a little after the wives jump and land on the ground so using your iframe ability right as they land on the ground will protect you from the freeze. Once Jang Ghibu uses his freeze ability, he will begin channeling his room-wide AOE. This AOE will come in 2 sets, both hitting 3 times. This AOE should be party protected with a Blade Master, Blade Dancer, or Force Master's party protects. If you have both a Force Master and a Blade Master/Blade Dancer, organize beforehand who will block the first set of explosions and who will block the second set of explosions. At the beginning of the second set of explosions, the wives will begin spinning in random directions, knocking up anyone hit by them. At this point, Jang Ghibu will regain his defensive buffs so you should hug a wall and try to avoid the spins instead of DPSing Jang Ghibu. After the explosions, the wives will return to attacking their respective aggro-holders and Jang Ghibu will switch to ice stance.
                        <br><br>
                        <h5 class="teal-text"><i class="material-icons left" style="padding-top:1px;margin-left: 4px;">replay</i>Second Phase</h5>
                        After the explosions, the wives will recover back to 100% HP and Jang Ghibu will regain his defensive buffs. This phase should be treated the exact same way as the first phase although there will be 2 main differences in this phase; Jang Ghibu will change his attack pattern upon changing to ice stance and wife tankers will be occasionally frozen.
                        <br><br>
                        Jang Ghibu will periodically freeze one of the wife tanks, dashing towards them and begins channeling a high damage skill in the direction of the frozen target. This freeze can be iframed but is fairly hard to do if the wife tanker is not paying attention to the main boss. A text bubble will appear above Jang Ghibu and he will aim in the direction of who he will be freezing before he freezes his target. When the text bubble appears, you can dodge the freeze by using an iframe but this does not stop him from dashing towards the tank and channeling his attack. Regardless of whether the tank gets frozen or not, once Jang Ghibu dashes and begins his channeling, the party should stun him to prevent his attack from going off. Then either the wife tank or Jang Ghibu's tank should lure their respective targets away from each other as to not get caught in the crossfire of the bosses. At 40% HP he will repeat his explosion phase so be sure to have your party iframes up and ready to use.
                        <br><br>
                        <h5 class="teal-text"><i class="material-icons left" style="padding-top:1px;margin-left: 4px;">warning</i>Closing Out</h5>
                        Once Jang Ghibu is down to 40% HP you should proceed to get the defensive buffs off of him as usual, but your party might want to consider slowing down their DPS on Jang Ghibu as the next phase begins at 20% meaning it'll occur sooner than the other phases. The purpose of slowing down your DPS is to allow cooldowns on your party block to come back up to block Jang Ghibu's triple explosion. The only difference at this 20% phase is that Jang Ghibu will begin casting his AOE right away and his wives will begin spinning right away. This will only be a single set of explosions, you can then kill Jang Ghibu followed by his two wives closing out the first boss battle of Desolate Tomb.

                        Second Boss - Iron Juggernaut
                        <br><br>
                        Iron Juggernaut
                        The Iron Juggernaut is considered the easiest boss in Desolate Tomb but requires quite a bit of coordination. There will be 3 main components to the Iron Juggernaut which are based on TIME rather than HP. It is important that the main tank for the Iron Juggernaut to stay VERY close to the boss. The maximum distance the tank should be from the boss is 3m, any further than that and the boss will pull you.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        Set-up
                        Before engaging onto the boss, you must split up your party into 3 main sections. Similar to how you designate 1 spot to each member in a square pattern for the twins in Shattered Masts, you will want to designate a spot to each member in a triangular shape for the Iron Juggernaut. A member should be placed at each of the following spots: 12 o'clock (in the far end behind the Iron Juggernaut), 4:30 o'clock (to the right of the entrance), and 7:30 o'clock (to the left of the entrance). The last member will tank the Iron Juggernaut.
                        <br><br>
                        General Strategy
                        [01:12:03] After a certain amount of time, the Iron Juggernaut will spawn 3 blue robots on the outer edge of the 3 designated spots. These blue robots will heal the boss for huge amounts. These robots must be killed quickly by the person designated to that area. If you are able to kill your robot quickly and notice other areas are still whacking at them, prioritize aiding the rest of your party instead of going back to the boss.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:15] After the blue robots are destroyed, there will be 3 red robots that spawn in the inner edge of the designated spots. YOU ARE NOT TO ATTACK THESE ROBOTS INITIALLY. If they are not attacked, they will all jump onto the main tanker. This will group them up allowing for the group to AOE them down. NOTE that if you see the robots begin to curl up, they are preparing to explode. You MUST prevent at least 2 from exploding by CC'ing them when they curl. These red robots will each drop a shield which should be picked up by 2 members.
                        <br><br>
                        At this time, the Iron Juggernaut will prepare its next phase. The attack pattern is as follows:
                           1.   Triple missiles onto the furthest member
                           2.   3 sparks onto the furthest player
                           3.   2 lasers at the furthest player
                           4.   3 sparks onto the furthest player
                        After the red robots die, one member should make their way to the very top of the stairs at the entrance, the 2 members with the shield should be at the base of the staircase on the right and the last member should be in melee range of the boss.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:30] Once the person at top of the staircase for the main entrance gets targeted, one of the shield-bearers will move to the top of the right staircase. The member at the entrance staircase will then be shot by 3 sets of AOE missiles, as they're dodging them, they will make their way down the stairs so that the first shield-bearer will be the furthest person for the next rotation.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:35] After the missiles, the shield-bearer will be locked on for the 3 sparks as he is the furthest person. This part is similar to blocking Iruga's lightning strikes in Sogun's Lament but you CANNOT spam 1 to block the sparks, you must time it so that you block exactly when the spark is about to hit you. After the 3 sparks, the first shield-bearer will throw his shield at the Iron Juggernaut. As the first shield-bearer is blocking the 3 sparks, they will make their way down the staircase and the second shield-bearer will make their way to the top.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:45] The second shield-bearer is preferably the tank as they are most likely to end with the Iron Juggernaut's aggro. They will stay at the top and get targeted by the 2 lasers, these lasers are not far enough to hit the shield-bearer if they are at the very top of the staircase. After the lasers, they will be locked-on again for the 3 sparks, which will be executed in the same fashion as the first shield-bearer.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:13:00] If AT LEAST 5 sparks were reflected, then the Iron Juggernaut will be downed. If there were less than 5 sparks reflected, then the Iron Juggernaut will perform a room-wide triple AOE will be performed. This process repeats until the boss is killed.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        Final Boss - Lord of the Flame
                        <br><br>
                        Lord of the Flame
                        The lord of the flame has 2 main components but is probably the easiest to wipe on. There are many things that must be executed flawlessly to clear the Lord of the Flame.
                        <br><br>
                        Set-up
                        There are 2 main things to figure out before engaging the Lord of the Flames.
                        <br><br>
                        First, you must determine and remember who the FIRST 3 members will HIT the boss. This will tie into his Flame Bomb mechanic.
                        <br><br>
                        Second, you must split your party so that there's a [Group of 3] and a [Group of 2], where 1 member will be part of both groups. This will be of importance for the Lord of the Flames' Gaze mechanic.
                        <br><br>
                        General Strategy
                        The Lord of the Flames has a time-based attack which will be referred to as his Flame Bomb mechanic. The first 3 people to hit the Lord of the Flames, in order, will each be tagged with a bomb after a certain amount of time. The bomb target will blow-up after the countdown is complete, knocking up the target and dealing damage to anyone nearby. The bomb targets are to isolate themselves and iframe the bomb explosion. After the bomb explodes, the Lord of the Flames will spit lava at the targets in the same sequence. At the beginning of the spit animation, the target is free to return to DPSing the Lord of the Flames. Try to keep the spit a safe distance away from the boss as to not hinder melee classes from DPSing. After the Lord of the Flames finishes spitting at all 3 targets, it will then proceed with a room-wide AOE. This repeats itself periodically and has a second part to it once the Lord of the Flames falls below 60% HP which will be discussed later.
                        <br><br>
                        The Gaze mechanic will be difficult to grasp immediately, but will result in a wipe if done incorrectly. The Gaze mechanic can be summed up as:
                        <br>
                        <span class="new badge left" data-badge-caption="%">90</span>  <span class="new badge left" data-badge-caption="%">60</span>  <span class="new badge left" data-badge-caption="%">30</span><br><br>
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2     (requires [Group of n])
                        Far     Close     Far     (Gaze Target is)
                        <br><br>
                        It is fairly easy to replicate this table by following the following steps:
                        2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 (repeat {2 3} until you have 9 digits)
                        <br><br>
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2 (separate the 9 digits into 3 sets)
                        <br><br>
                         90%  |  60%  |  30%
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2 (designate health percentages)
                        <br><br>
                         90%  |  60%  |  30%
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2
                        Far     Close     Far (designate condition of the Gaze Target)
                        [02:15:05] So the Gaze phase happens every 30% beginning at 90% HP.
                        At 90% the Gaze Target is always the person FARTHEST from the Lord of the Flames (IMPORTANT: the Gaze Target is the member of the party that is of both [Group of 2] AND [Group of 3]). Once designated as the Gaze Target, they must walk in front of the Lord of the Flames as the Lord of the Flames spawns 2 spark orbs beside himself. These spark orbs will target and head towards the Gaze Target after a momentary delay. 
                        <br><br>
                        Since the first number in the sequence is "2", you will need a group of 2 people (the members designated in [Group of 2]) to stand IN FRONT of the Lord of the Flames. The rest of the party members (i.e. [Group of 3] not including the Gaze Target) must stand BEHIND the Lord of the Flames.
                        <br><br>
                        Once hit by a spark orb, you will gain a buff. During the duration of this buff, if you are to be hit by another spark orb, it will be an instant-kill. The [Group of 2] will both get hit by one of the spark orbs. After getting hit by the spark orb, the NON-Gaze Target must run BEHIND the Gaze Target and the boss will shock the frontal targets.
                        <br><br>
                        The closest person to the Lord of the Flames will be grabbed and thrown, preferably the Gaze Target, which will set that person as the farthest and the new Gaze Target.
                        The Lord of the Flames will then jump at the TANK (not the Gaze Target! It is preferred to keep the boss in the center of the room). After the Gaze Target is chosen again, [Group of 3] will move to the front and the [Group of 2] (not including the Gaze Target) will go behind the Lord of the Flames.
                        <br><br>
                        2 more spark orbs will spawn beside the Lord of the Flames and will head towards the Gaze Target and the next number in the sequence is "3". Since the Gaze Target already has a stack of the spark orb, they cannot take another one. Therefore, the rest of [Group of 3] must take one orb each. The Lord of the Flames will repeat the grab and jump.
                        <br><br>
                        The last rotation for the first set is the most important. The buff will still be on both of the [Group of 2] members, meaning they cannot take any more spark orbs for a little while after. After the Lord of the Flame grabs and throws the second time, there will be a window to CC it. Ideally, there would be either a destroyer or summoner that can grapple the boss after the CC to stall for time. If one is not in the party, you will have to try to maximize the flight time (assign the flight job to one person to avoid accidental aerial inputs). You will have to delay the boss about approximately 6s for the buffs on the members of [Group of 2] to wear off. The last rotation of this set does not spawn any orbs and goes straight to the lightning.
                        <br><br>
                        This repeats for the next two sets, although the number of people change (refer to above chart) and the conditions to be the target also changes (farthest for 90%, closest for 60%, and farthest again for 30%). The last important thing to note is that the Gaze Target MUST NOT get grabbed for the final rotation of the 3rd set! If the target is grabbed for the final rotation the Lord of the Flames will enrage and wipe the party. [02:19:30]
