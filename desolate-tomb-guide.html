                        Last updated February xx, 2017
                        <br><br><br>
                        Upon entering Desolate Tomb, you will be greeted by a room that spans downwards. it is relatively safe to jump down as long as you stay on the side of the entrance. This room will be surrounded by mobs and one mini-boss traversing the center. The mini-boss in the center must be killed to open the dragon pulse which will lead you to the first boss. This mini-boss is also what progresses your daily quest for Desolate Tomb, meaning he should not be killed until all party members are present in the dungeon! There are two main strategies in killing this mini-boss.
                        <br><br>

                                            The general strategy to clear this room is for one party member to aggro the mini-boss running to the bottom left of the room where all the mobs will converge and get AOE'd down. This is the recommended method but may not be feasable for a low AP party as the mobs will perform a lot of CC abilities, allowing a lot of damage to go through and killing a lot of party members.

                                            If you have an Assassin in your party, the Assassin can perma-stealth on the main boss and aggro all the mobs in the room. If the Assassin is well geared they can kill the mini-boss by themselves, if they aren't then they can go through their perma-stealth rotation until the mobs in the room de-aggro and pull mini-boss by himself to the rest of the party stationed at the stairs at the bottom of the entrance.

                        After killing the mini-boss, a dragon pulse will spawn on the bottom-right side of the room, leading you up to the corridor before the first boss, Jang Ghibu.

                        <br><br>First Boss - Jang Ghibu
                        <br><br>
                        Jang Ghibu (Main Boss)
                        Jang Ghibu (force master) is accompanied by his two wives (both destroyers). He has 3 main phases occuring at 70%, 40%, and 25%. It is recommended to have at least one ranged class for this boss Killing either Mengwol or Muwol before Jang Ghibu will result in an enrage and your party will be wiped.
                        <br><br>
                        Mengwol (Left Destroyer Add)
                        It is recommended to have a ranged class tank Mengwol as many of her attacks are unblockable, making it a bad match for melee classes. The ranged DPS should kite Mengwol, keeping far enough to avoid her attacks as well as close enough to not be pulled back. A safe distance to maintain against Mengwol is between 6-8m away.
                        <br><br>
                        Muwol (Right Destroyer Add)
                        Muwol is more flexible as anybody can tank her. Her attack pattern consists of three blockable line AOE in front of her followed by a parry spin (same as destroyer spins in PvP). The main mechanic to pay attention to is Muwol's parry spin, try to avoid hitting within the first 0.5s of her spin. If she deflects your attack, she will use anklebiter to knock you down, launch you up, and piledriver you into the ground.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        General Strategy
                        There will be one tank on each Jang Ghibu, Mengwol, and Muwol. The 4th member will switch between targets depending on which needs to be DPSed further.
                        <br><br>
                        Jang Ghibu has 3 main phases, occurring at 70%, 40%, and 25%.
                        Trying to burst Jang Ghibu is fairly difficult as he has 2 defensive buffs which reduce a large amount of damage. When you damage either Mengwol or Muwol down to 70% hp, Jang Ghibu will protect his wife by giving them one of his defensive buff. After giving both Mengwol and Muwol his defensive buffs, you will be able to DPS Jang Ghibu and he will begin his special phases at the above health marks.
                        <br><br>
                        At 70% HP [00:53:30] Jang Ghibu will retrieve his 2 defensive buffs from his wives, restoring both Mengwol's and Muwol's back to full HP, he will do a room-wide AOE freezing anything hit (can be iframed), followed by 2 sets of triple knockback AOE (similar to Awakened Necropolis' Nightmare Waves). Once he finishes his attack, he will switch his stance from fire to ice, changing his attack pattern to an ice set of attacks.
                        <br><br>
                        The 40% HP [00:54:30] phase is exactly the same as his 70% HP phase, switching back to fire stance. After he completes his attack, he will begin to randomly freeze one of the tanks of Mengwol or Muwol every ~30 seconds. Jang Ghibu will then dash to the frozen target and charge up a powerful spell which MUST be CC'd (most likely by Jang Ghibu's tanker). At this time, you will most likely want to slow down the DPS on Jang Ghibu as the next phase begins at 25%. DPSing Jang Ghibu too quickly will not provide enough time for your party blocks to come off cooldown.
                        <br><br>
                        25% HP [00:55:25] will NOT have a freeze AOE and will have only 1 set of triple explosions, after this you can kill Jang Ghibu and then kill both Mengwol and Muwol.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>

                        Second Boss - Iron Juggernaut
                        <br><br>
                        Iron Juggernaut
                        The Iron Juggernaut is considered the easiest boss in Desolate Tomb but requires quite a bit of coordination. There will be 3 main components to the Iron Juggernaut which are based on TIME rather than HP. It is important that the main tank for the Iron Juggernaut to stay VERY close to the boss. The maximum distance the tank should be from the boss is 3m, any further than that and the boss will pull you.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        Set-up
                        Before engaging onto the boss, you must split up your party into 3 main sections. Similar to how you designate 1 spot to each member in a square pattern for the twins in Shattered Masts, you will want to designate a spot to each member in a triangular shape for the Iron Juggernaut. A member should be placed at each of the following spots: 12 o'clock (in the far end behind the Iron Juggernaut), 4:30 o'clock (to the right of the entrance), and 7:30 o'clock (to the left of the entrance). The last member will tank the Iron Juggernaut.
                        <br><br>
                        General Strategy
                        [01:12:03] After a certain amount of time, the Iron Juggernaut will spawn 3 blue robots on the outer edge of the 3 designated spots. These blue robots will heal the boss for huge amounts. These robots must be killed quickly by the person designated to that area. If you are able to kill your robot quickly and notice other areas are still whacking at them, prioritize aiding the rest of your party instead of going back to the boss.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:15] After the blue robots are destroyed, there will be 3 red robots that spawn in the inner edge of the designated spots. YOU ARE NOT TO ATTACK THESE ROBOTS INITIALLY. If they are not attacked, they will all jump onto the main tanker. This will group them up allowing for the group to AOE them down. NOTE that if you see the robots begin to curl up, they are preparing to explode. You MUST prevent at least 2 from exploding by CC'ing them when they curl. These red robots will each drop a shield which should be picked up by 2 members.
                        <br><br>
                        At this time, the Iron Juggernaut will prepare its next phase. The attack pattern is as follows:
                           1.   Triple missiles onto the furthest member
                           2.   3 sparks onto the furthest player
                           3.   2 lasers at the furthest player
                           4.   3 sparks onto the furthest player
                        After the red robots die, one member should make their way to the very top of the stairs at the entrance, the 2 members with the shield should be at the base of the staircase on the right and the last member should be in melee range of the boss.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:30] Once the person at top of the staircase for the main entrance gets targeted, one of the shield-bearers will move to the top of the right staircase. The member at the entrance staircase will then be shot by 3 sets of AOE missiles, as they're dodging them, they will make their way down the stairs so that the first shield-bearer will be the furthest person for the next rotation.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:35] After the missiles, the shield-bearer will be locked on for the 3 sparks as he is the furthest person. This part is similar to blocking Iruga's lightning strikes in Sogun's Lament but you CANNOT spam 1 to block the sparks, you must time it so that you block exactly when the spark is about to hit you. After the 3 sparks, the first shield-bearer will throw his shield at the Iron Juggernaut. As the first shield-bearer is blocking the 3 sparks, they will make their way down the staircase and the second shield-bearer will make their way to the top.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:12:45] The second shield-bearer is preferably the tank as they are most likely to end with the Iron Juggernaut's aggro. They will stay at the top and get targeted by the 2 lasers, these lasers are not far enough to hit the shield-bearer if they are at the very top of the staircase. After the lasers, they will be locked-on again for the 3 sparks, which will be executed in the same fashion as the first shield-bearer.
                        <br><br>
                        [01:13:00] If AT LEAST 5 sparks were reflected, then the Iron Juggernaut will be downed. If there were less than 5 sparks reflected, then the Iron Juggernaut will perform a room-wide triple AOE will be performed. This process repeats until the boss is killed.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        Final Boss - Lord of the Flame
                        <br><br>
                        Lord of the Flame
                        The lord of the flame has 2 main components but is probably the easiest to wipe on. There are many things that must be executed flawlessly to clear the Lord of the Flame.
                        <br><br>
                        Set-up
                        There are 2 main things to figure out before engaging the Lord of the Flames.
                        <br><br>
                        First, you must determine and remember who the FIRST 3 members will HIT the boss. This will tie into his Flame Bomb mechanic.
                        <br><br>
                        Second, you must split your party so that there's a [Group of 3] and a [Group of 2], where 1 member will be part of both groups. This will be of importance for the Lord of the Flames' Gaze mechanic.
                        <br><br>
                        General Strategy
                        The Lord of the Flames has a time-based attack which will be referred to as his Flame Bomb mechanic. The first 3 people to hit the Lord of the Flames, in order, will each be tagged with a bomb after a certain amount of time. The bomb target will blow-up after the countdown is complete, knocking up the target and dealing damage to anyone nearby. The bomb targets are to isolate themselves and iframe the bomb explosion. After the bomb explodes, the Lord of the Flames will spit lava at the targets in the same sequence. At the beginning of the spit animation, the target is free to return to DPSing the Lord of the Flames. Try to keep the spit a safe distance away from the boss as to not hinder melee classes from DPSing. After the Lord of the Flames finishes spitting at all 3 targets, it will then proceed with a room-wide AOE. This repeats itself periodically and has a second part to it once the Lord of the Flames falls below 60% HP which will be discussed later.
                        <br><br>
                        The Gaze mechanic will be difficult to grasp immediately, but will result in a wipe if done incorrectly. The Gaze mechanic can be summed up as:
                        <br>
                        <span class="new badge left" data-badge-caption="%">90</span>  <span class="new badge left" data-badge-caption="%">60</span>  <span class="new badge left" data-badge-caption="%">30</span><br><br>
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2     (requires [Group of n])
                        Far     Close     Far     (Gaze Target is)
                        <br><br>
                        It is fairly easy to replicate this table by following the following steps:
                        2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 (repeat {2 3} until you have 9 digits)
                        <br><br>
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2 (separate the 9 digits into 3 sets)
                        <br><br>
                         90%  |  60%  |  30%
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2 (designate health percentages)
                        <br><br>
                         90%  |  60%  |  30%
                        2 3 2 | 3 2 3 | 2 3 2
                        Far     Close     Far (designate condition of the Gaze Target)
                        [02:15:05] So the Gaze phase happens every 30% beginning at 90% HP.
                        At 90% the Gaze Target is always the person FARTHEST from the Lord of the Flames (IMPORTANT: the Gaze Target is the member of the party that is of both [Group of 2] AND [Group of 3]). Once designated as the Gaze Target, they must walk in front of the Lord of the Flames as the Lord of the Flames spawns 2 spark orbs beside himself. These spark orbs will target and head towards the Gaze Target after a momentary delay. 
                        <br><br>
                        Since the first number in the sequence is "2", you will need a group of 2 people (the members designated in [Group of 2]) to stand IN FRONT of the Lord of the Flames. The rest of the party members (i.e. [Group of 3] not including the Gaze Target) must stand BEHIND the Lord of the Flames.
                        <br><br>
                        Once hit by a spark orb, you will gain a buff. During the duration of this buff, if you are to be hit by another spark orb, it will be an instant-kill. The [Group of 2] will both get hit by one of the spark orbs. After getting hit by the spark orb, the NON-Gaze Target must run BEHIND the Gaze Target and the boss will shock the frontal targets.
                        <br><br>
                        The closest person to the Lord of the Flames will be grabbed and thrown, preferably the Gaze Target, which will set that person as the farthest and the new Gaze Target.
                        The Lord of the Flames will then jump at the TANK (not the Gaze Target! It is preferred to keep the boss in the center of the room). After the Gaze Target is chosen again, [Group of 3] will move to the front and the [Group of 2] (not including the Gaze Target) will go behind the Lord of the Flames.
                        <br><br>
                        2 more spark orbs will spawn beside the Lord of the Flames and will head towards the Gaze Target and the next number in the sequence is "3". Since the Gaze Target already has a stack of the spark orb, they cannot take another one. Therefore, the rest of [Group of 3] must take one orb each. The Lord of the Flames will repeat the grab and jump.
                        <br><br>
                        The last rotation for the first set is the most important. The buff will still be on both of the [Group of 2] members, meaning they cannot take any more spark orbs for a little while after. After the Lord of the Flame grabs and throws the second time, there will be a window to CC it. Ideally, there would be either a destroyer or summoner that can grapple the boss after the CC to stall for time. If one is not in the party, you will have to try to maximize the flight time (assign the flight job to one person to avoid accidental aerial inputs). You will have to delay the boss about approximately 6s for the buffs on the members of [Group of 2] to wear off. The last rotation of this set does not spawn any orbs and goes straight to the lightning.
                        <br><br>
                        This repeats for the next two sets, although the number of people change (refer to above chart) and the conditions to be the target also changes (farthest for 90%, closest for 60%, and farthest again for 30%). The last important thing to note is that the Gaze Target MUST NOT get grabbed for the final rotation of the 3rd set! If the target is grabbed for the final rotation the Lord of the Flames will enrage and wipe the party. [02:19:30]
